## 🏆 Featured Personal Project

### Tennis Coach App 🎾
A coaching assistant app for casual tennis players. Designed to empower players by providing analysis and feedback on common tennis techniques and tracking improvements over time.
I'm currently working on a feature to analyse a player's posture on groundstroke contact with the ball during a rally.
